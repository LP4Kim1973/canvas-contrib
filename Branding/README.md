Branding Canvas with CSS and JavaScript
======

This folder contains some example CSS and JavaScript files that can be
used to give Canvas your institution's look and feel. There are several
subfolders that denote the purpose of each set of CSS/JS files. These
are described below.

As always, this is provided AS-IS, without warranty, and without any
support beyond this document and anyone kind enough to help from the
community.

Installation
======

To use a custom CSS or JavaScript file, you must enable these features
in your General Account Management page. A link to this page is available
in the "Courses" drop-down menu if you are an administrator for your
account. If you are not an administrator, you will need to either request
permission or ask for your existing administrator to enable these
features for you.

Once enabled, you'll need to accomplish the following to enable your
branding:

1. Host your CSS and JavaScript files on a web server with a valid SSL
   certificate.
2. Update your account settings with the correct links to these files
3. Test!

Hosting
------

Depending on your familiarity with CSS/JavaScript, this might be the most
difficult step. You will need to host both the CSS and JavaScript on a
secure web server which must be available to the general public. Note
that this excludes servers that can only be accessed on campus.

The web server you select also must have a valid SSL certificate for the
URL from which the CSS/JavaScript will be hosted.

There are several excellent open-source software stacks that can be used
to build a server with these capabilities: Ubuntu (a distribution of
the Linux OS) is packaged with the Apache web server. Selection and setup
of these applications/services is beyond the scope of this document. If
you run into trouble, the community could be convinced to rise to your
aid.

Account Configuration
------

When you have a link (i.e. "http://link.to/your/css") that is visible to
anyone, anywhere, you're ready to configure your institution's Canvas
account. Again, if you aren't an administrator, you'll need to either
request administrator privileges or ask your administrator to apply
these settings.

1. Click on your institution's general account management link (from the
   "Courses" drop-down menu).
2. Click on "Settings".
3. Enter the URL for each file (the CSS and JavaScript files) in the
   text fields labeled, "Global JavaScript URL" and "Global CSS URL".
4. Click "Update Settings"

Your browser should refresh the current page and apply the branding.

Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in 
mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this.
That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep
both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
