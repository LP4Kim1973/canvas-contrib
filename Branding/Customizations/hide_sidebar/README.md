Hiding wiki(page) sidebar with JavaScript and CSS
======

This script, which would be included on an account's global branding javascript file, will
hide the wiki sidebar for users that are either not-logged in (applicable to public
courses) or are students in the course without rights to edit the page.

Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in 
mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this.
That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep
both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
